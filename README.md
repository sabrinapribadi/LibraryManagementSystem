# **LibraryManagementSystem**

> This project was developed as an Exam in the Python For Software Engineering Course at [Pacmann.AI Data Science Programm](https://pacmann.io/sekolah-data-science).

## Rubics

1. Running Program Features
  - Library member registration
  - New book registration
  - Borrowing
  - Displays Member data, Books, and Return lists
  - Can do a book search
2. Successful Transaction Processing program with database 
  - Member Data
  - Book Data
  - Return Data
  - The program is built by taking into account the Functional Concept or Object Oriented Programming.
3. Clean Code (Documentation)
